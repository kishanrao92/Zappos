Roll A Ball:

The objective of the game is to get the required number of points by rolling a ball into a set of cubes. Each cube would count as one point  and the user wins if he gets the required number of points before the timer runs down.

The user can choose between Easy and Hard levels and user input is taken from the keyboard using arrow keys or the w,a,s,d combination.

If the timer runs down then the user loses the game.
